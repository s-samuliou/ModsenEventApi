# Introduction
I made the basic functionality of the application. I did not add Business Logic, because all the main actions take place in DataAccess and do not change in any way in Business Logic. 
Unfortunately, I have never worked with JwtBearer, but I have a theoretical idea of how it should work.

# Getting started
TO DO: To run and code in your own system - go through the following steps:
1. Change in appsettings.json DB name.
2. At startup, press f5 to create the database.
3. After you have launched the application by pressing f5 - make a request to get information from the database.
